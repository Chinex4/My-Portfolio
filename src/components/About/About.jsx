                        I enjoy Frontend development and working with React, but it wasn't always like that. I went through a 2-year Information Technology program and learned nothing about web development. I didn't even how to structure HTML codes until my sophmore year in the university, but once I discovered Frontend development I immediately fell in love. Through hours and months of studying and practicing, leveraging courses online and other e-learning material, I was eventually able to self-tutor myself into learning some frontend Technologies including: HTML, CSS, Javacript.

                        In recent times I have been working with ReactJS (a Javascript library) to build amazing user interfaces and experience. I am currently a React Frontend Developer.
